## Analysis

the plan was to make a pong game with fun physics to play with,
fun hit angles and a changing speed mechanic
which would promote skill in moving the paddle in the right way
and at the right times to get a higher score.

i partly succeeded, but physics are sometimes a bit wonky in some edge cases which i did not manage to snuff out.

## Design

moving the paddle in the same direction as the ball/logo is moving when it hits the paddle.
makes the ball slow down if you move against it when it hits it speeds up.

the angle the ball bounces at depends on where it hits the paddle.

## FUN

hope you think its fun, i had alot of fun playing it at least and making i.
i might just improve it this weekend.
